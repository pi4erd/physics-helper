# physics-helper

**physics-helper** is a tool for creating and customizing physics simulations.
This project is part of my university degree.

## Features

The **physics-helper** contains several engines that simplify creaton and interaction for simulations:
 - Physics engine - a helper engine that abstracts internal functionality of simulation
   and creates a unified interface for simulations
 - Visualization engine - a visualizer that contains several helper functions
   to simplify visualizing internal state of physics engines

Currently (as of 2025-04-29) the only type of simulation available is particle simulation.

## Future plans

In the future, I plan to add:
 - Field simulation - a simulation engine to simplify creating simulations
   for grids of cells each with some numeric value
 - Complete customizability - you will be able to customize your simulation
   starting from what properties particles have, ending with fundamental interactions
   between these particles. (and of course the same goes for field simulations)
